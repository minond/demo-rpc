Playing around with RPC services, specifically, gRPC. This demo creates a simple service for managing your friends.

Run `go run src/server.go` to start the RPC server and `go run src/client.go` to make calls. Run `go run src/client.go -help` to see what you can do with the client. To re-build the code, just run `make build`. Here's an of how the client works:

    $ go run src/client.go -create "Marcos"
    Ok: true
    Message: Created id:1 name:"Marcos"
    $ go run src/client.go -create "Hannah"
    Ok: true
    Message: Created id:2 name:"Hannah"
    $ go run src/client.go -create "Ryan"
    Ok: true
    Message: Created id:3 name:"Ryan"
    $ go run src/client.go -search "y"
    Result: id:3 name:"Ryan"
    $ go run src/client.go -search "n"
    Result: id:2 name:"Hannah"
    Result: id:3 name:"Ryan"
    $ go run src/client.go -search "a"
    Result: id:2 name:"Hannah"
    Result: id:3 name:"Ryan"
    Result: id:1 name:"Marcos"
